# stack-yaml

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phlummox/stack-yaml.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/phlummox/stack-yaml)

## About

`stack-yaml` parses [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) configuration files.

Its advantage is that it's less enormous than `stack`.

## Installation

~~~
stack install stack-yaml
~~~


## Testing

To build and perform (desultory) testing:

~~~
cd stack-yaml
stack test
~~~
